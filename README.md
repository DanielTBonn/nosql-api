# Nosql API

## Description
  
To familiarize myself with mongodb and nosql databases, I created the backend of a social network database. Building a backend from mongodb is a building block for modern web developer tools and is going to be very important for filling out my understanding of the MERN stack. I learned about using module exports to create controllers for my models and clean up routing by importaing them as well as basic syntax for developing mongodb schema.
